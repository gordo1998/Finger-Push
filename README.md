Run the program:
To run this program you need to have:
- Mysql
- Xampp

In Msql you have to import the Pulsador.sql file and then execute everything.
In Xampp you have to execute the Apache server, but before, you need to put the project in the next route:
../../xammp/htdocs/

To run the index.html you have to go to the browser and put:
localhost:80/"yourNameProject"

If you don't have the Mysql server but you have Xampp, you can execute the Mysql server in Xampp.

Warning:
If you have Xampp and Mysql server, dont't run both (Xampp Mysql server, Mysql server). Only run one or other.
